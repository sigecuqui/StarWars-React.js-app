      <p className="App-about">
        Star Wars is an American epic space opera multimedia franchise created
        by George Lucas, which began with the eponymous 1977 film and quickly
        became a worldwide pop-culture phenomenon. The franchise has been
        expanded into various films and other media, including television
        series, video games, novels, comic books, theme park attractions, and
        themed areas, comprising an all-encompassing fictional universe. In
        2020, its total value was estimated at US$70 billion, and it is
        currently the fifth-highest-grossing media franchise of all time.

        The original film (Star Wars), retroactively subtitled Episode IV: A New
        Hope (1977), was followed by the sequels Episode V: The Empire Strikes
        Back (1980) and Episode VI: Return of the Jedi (1983), forming the
        original Star Wars trilogy. Lucas later returned to filmmaking to direct
        a prequel trilogy, consisting of Episode I: The Phantom Menace (1999),
        Episode II: Attack of the Clones (2002), and Episode III: Revenge of the
        Sith (2005). In 2012, Lucas sold his production company to Disney,
        relinquishing his ownership of the franchise. The subsequently produced
        sequel trilogy consists of Episode VII: The Force Awakens (2015),
        Episode VIII: The Last Jedi (2017), and Episode IX: The Rise of
        Skywalker (2019). All nine films of the 'Skywalker saga' were nominated
        for Academy Awards with wins going to the first two releases. Together
        with the theatrical live action spin-off films Rogue One (2016) and Solo
        (2018), the combined box office revenue of the films equated to over
        US$10 billion, which makes it the second-highest-grossing film franchise
        of all time, and fifth-highest-grossing media franchise of all time.
